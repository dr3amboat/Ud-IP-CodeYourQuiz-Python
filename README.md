# Udacity-Intro-to-Programming-Code-Your-Own-Quiz
Udacity Intro to Programming Nanodegree Project : Code Your Own Quiz

## Project Specification

### Code a Fill-in-the-Blanks Quiz
You've built a Mad-Libs game with some help from Sean. Now you'll work on your own game to practice your skills and demonstrate what you've learned.

For this project you'll be building a fill-in-the-blanks quiz. Your quiz will prompt a user with a sentence containing several blanks. The user should then be asked to fill in each blank appropriately to complete the sentence. This can be used as a study tool to help you remember important vocabulary!

You can find some starter code for this project along with all the other lessons in the Supporting Materials below.

In addition to the starter code file (fill-in-the-blanks.py) we've also given you a file called fill-in-the-blanks.pyc which is a working version of the project. A .pyc file is a Python file that has been translated into "byte code". This means the code will run the same as the original .py file, but if you open it in your text editor, it won't look like Python! You can run it just like a regular Python file to see how your code should behave.

### Advice
Check out the Project Submission Details! If you get stuck, check out the forums for common problems students face when attempting this project. If you need, schedule a 1:1 appointment with one of our mentors to get you un-stuck. This project should be fun. If at any time it becomes "not-fun", take a step back, deep breath, and ask for help!

## Project Submission
In this project, you will use the Python programming language to build your own quiz. You will use a fill-in-the blank style to create a quiz that can even be used as a study tool to help you remember important vocabulary.

### 1 - Game Review
In this portion of the review, your reviewer will be checking to make sure the game works the way it's supposed to. See the rubric below for exact specs.

### 2 - Code Review
Your reviewer will also look at the Python code you've written and provide feedback on:

* **Use of Variables**: Your code should take advantage of variables and variable **names** should reflect the **values** they store.
* **Functions**: Your code should use functions appropriately to avoid repetition. Function parameters should have logical names and should all be used in the body of the function.
* **Appropriate use of Data**: Data types (strings vs lists for example) should be used appropriately.
* **Appropriate use of other coding techniques**: Your code should use statements like if, elif, else, while, etc... appropriately.
* **Each function includes a comment**: Comments explain function behavior, inputs, and outputs (if applicable.)

The rubric that will be used is here.
